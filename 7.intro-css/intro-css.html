                With their 2nd album of this trilogy BTS offers the message that “you must find your happiness 
                and your own life before it’s too late.”
                <br>
                Lyrics that brutally lay open reality as it is deliver a bold admonition to a world that inflicts 
                despair. Children are raised as studying machines without a chance to think about the future.
                A world where classmates are not friends but competitors trying to trample each other. BTS sings
                about the wounds and anguish that such hopeless life has left on today’s teens...

                    Focusing on school and teens. The album’s main theme is the love that blossoms in the school.
                    This album is a culmination of the “School Trilogy” project that discusses the topics of most 
                    interest to teens their own age—dreams, happiness and love. Such penetrating insight into the 
                    hearts and minds of young people led to the absolute support that BTS has received from fans their age.

                    The boys are no longer in their school uniforms. They have become tougher, singing that their love is 
                    not to be treated lightly. A year and two months into their debut, BTS made sure that the visuals, performance 
                    and all the elements of their first studio album are flawless. Tracks that highlight the different genres 
                    of hip hop—South, West, Boom Bap and Trap—provide a clear direction of BTS' music.
